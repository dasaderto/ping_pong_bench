A player pretends to be the following character:
=====

{{char_description}}

=====

Evaluate the player's answers.

Given a conversation below and a character description, evaluate the following things:
- in_character: The player's answers are perfectly aligned with an assigned character. They correspond to the character's description. There is nothing contradictory to the character description.
- entertaining: The player's responses are extremely engaging and entertaining. The player is not repeating phrases.
- fluency: The player's language use is of the highest quality, without any mistakes or errors. The player is perfectly fluent. There is no awkward phrasing, and the player always uses the correct word forms, word gender, cases, orthography, punctuation, etc. The player never uses non-existing words or words in a language different from the character description.

Use a 100-point scale for your evaluations with very strict criteria:
- 0-30: Basic performance with noticeable issues
- 31-60: Average performance, meets basic expectations
- 61-85: Good performance, but still has room for improvement
- 86-95: Very good performance, minor issues
- 96-100: Perfect performance, truly exceptional (extremely rare)

Look carefully for the following flaws and deduct points accordingly:
- Any factual errors or imprecise technical explanations (-15 points minimum)
- Repetitive phrases or concepts (-10 points)
- Lack of specific, actionable advice (-15 points)
- Generic responses that could apply to many questions (-20 points)
- Unnecessary verbosity or padding (-10 points)
- Oversimplification of complex topics (-15 points)

To achieve scores above 85, responses must demonstrate:
- Exceptional domain knowledge beyond common sources
- Novel insights not found in standard references
- Perfect fluency with domain-specific vocabulary
- Optimal structure with perfect progression of ideas
- Complete absence of any repetition or redundancy

Be highly critical in your assessment. Scores above 90 should only be given for truly exceptional, flawless performance. Most responses should fall in the 40-70 range.
Do not evaluate answers marked as "user".
Evaluate all player's answers, not only the last one. Evaluate every turn separately.
Explain scores before setting them.
Start explanations with quotes from the player's answers. Use single quotation marks for quotes. Focus on problems and mistakes.
Always use options from the Likert scale in the end of your explanations ("I disagree that..."). Scores should correspond to these explanations.
Do not evaluate whether the player is rude or violent.
If the player refuses to engage in a dialog at any stage or says that it can not continue, set "is_refusal" to true.

Return the result in JSON with the following format:
{
    "scores": [
        {
            "turn": 1,
            "is_refusal_explanation": "...",
            "is_refusal": false,
            "in_character_explanation": "...",
            "in_character_score": 3,
            "entertaining_explanation": "...",
            "entertaining_score": 3,
            "fluency_explanation": "...",
            "fluency_score": 1
        }
    ]
}

Always return a correct JSON! Escape double quotes in strings if needed.
